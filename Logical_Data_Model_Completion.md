# 4.9 Logical Data Model (Completion)

The Logical Data Model defines the structure of data elements and their relationships without considering physical implementation details. It provides a blueprint for database design, focusing on entities, attributes, and normalization.

## 4.9.1 Data Dictionary (DD)

The Data Dictionary describes each data element, including its name, type, size, and description. It serves as a reference for developers and database administrators to ensure consistent data usage.

## 4.9.2 Physical Data Model

The Physical Data Model translates the logical design into a physical structure optimized for the chosen database system. It includes table definitions, indexes, constraints, and storage considerations to support efficient data access and integrity.

## 4.9.3 Logical Data Model Details

### 1. Entities and Attributes

- **User**
  - UserID (Primary Key)
  - Name
  - Role (Admin, Student, Instructor, Invigilator, Security)
  - Email
  - Password
  - FingerprintID (Foreign Key)
  
- **Course**
  - CourseID (Primary Key)
  - CourseName
  - Description
  - InstructorID (Foreign Key)
  
- **Attendance**
  - AttendanceID (Primary Key)
  - SessionID (Foreign Key)
  - StudentID (Foreign Key)
  - Status (Present/Absent)
  - Timestamp
  
- **Session**
  - SessionID (Primary Key)
  - CourseID (Foreign Key)
  - Date
  - Time
  - Location
  
- **Fingerprint**
  - FingerprintID (Primary Key)
  - UserID (Foreign Key)
  - FingerprintData
  - EnrollmentDate
  
- **Report**
  - ReportID (Primary Key)
  - GeneratedBy (UserID, Foreign Key)
  - DateGenerated
  - ReportType
  - Content

### 2. Relationships

- Users enroll in Courses.
- Instructors manage Courses.
- Students attend Sessions.
- Attendance records link Students to Sessions.
- Fingerprint data is linked to Users.
- Reports are generated by Admin or other roles.

### 3. Diagram

Include an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing entities, attributes, and relationships with cardinalities.

### 4. Normalization

The data model is designed to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity by normalizing entities and relationships appropriately.

This logical data model provides a clear, technology-agnostic view of the data structure and relationships in the system, serving as a foundation for physical database design.
