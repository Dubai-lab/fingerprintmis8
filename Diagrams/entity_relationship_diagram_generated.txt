Relationships:

User is generalized into Student, Instructor, Invigilator, Admin, Security.
Students enroll in Courses via "students" subcollection under "instructor_courses".
Instructors teach Courses via instructorId field in "instructor_courses".
Attendance sessions link to Courses via courseId.
Attendance records link Students to Courses and Sessions.
Invigilator attendance records are activity-based and stored separately.
Security personnel verify students using fingerprint data from "students" collection.
