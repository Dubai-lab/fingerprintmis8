  **User (Conceptual Model)**
  Represents all users in the system regardless of role.
  
  **Note:**
  In the actual implementation, users are stored in separate 
  collections based on their role:
  - Students in 'students' collection
  - Instructors in 'instructors' collection
  - Admins in 'admins' collection
  - Invigilators in 'invigilators' collection
  - Security personnel in 'security' collection
  
  This diagram represents the conceptual view of a user entity 
  that encompasses all roles in the system.
  
  **Attributes:**
  - userID: Unique identifier for each user (Primary Key)
  - name: Full name of the user
  - role: User role (Admin, Student, Instructor, Invigilator, Security)
  - email: User's email address
  - password: Hashed password for authentication
  - fingerprintID: Reference to fingerprint data (Foreign Key)
