2.2 Definition of Key Terms

To facilitate a clear understanding of the concepts discussed in this chapter, the following key terms are defined as they relate to attendance management systems and biometric technologies:

2.2.1 Attendance System  
A system designed to record and monitor the presence of individuals in a specific environment, typically used in educational institutions and workplaces.

2.2.2 Biometric Technology  
Technological methods that use unique physiological or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris patterns, to identify and authenticate individuals.

2.2.3 Fingerprint Recognition  
A biometric technique that analyzes the unique patterns of ridges and valleys on a person's fingertip to verify identity.

2.2.4 Management Information System (MIS)

2.2.5 Proxy Attendance  
The act of one individual marking attendance on behalf of another, often considered fraudulent.

2.2.6 Real-Time Data Processing  
The capability of a system to process and provide data immediately as it is collected, enabling timely responses and decisions.

2.2.7 Cross-Platform Application  
An application designed to operate on multiple operating systems or devices with minimal modification.

These definitions provide a foundational understanding for the subsequent discussions and analyses in this chapter.
