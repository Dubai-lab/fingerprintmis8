4.6 Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) represents the flow of data within the Fingerprint-Based Attendance and Management System. It illustrates how data moves between processes, data stores, and external entities.

The DFD helps in identifying the inputs, outputs, and storage points of data, providing a clear understanding of the system's data processing and management. It serves as a foundation for system design and implementation.
