2.5 Personal Contribution

This study contributes to the field of attendance management systems by developing a Fingerprint-Based Attendance and Management Information System (MIS) that integrates biometric authentication with a comprehensive management platform. The personal contributions of this research include:

- Designing and implementing a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter, enabling accessibility across multiple devices and operating systems.

- Developing a custom fingerprint SDK to facilitate reliable and secure biometric enrollment and verification, addressing hardware compatibility challenges.

- Integrating Firebase services to provide real-time data synchronization, user authentication, cloud functions, and analytics, enhancing system scalability and maintainability.

- Conducting a thorough comparative analysis of existing attendance systems to identify gaps and inform the design of the proposed solution.

- Implementing robust security measures to protect user data and ensure compliance with privacy standards.

- Evaluating the systemâ€™s performance and usability through comprehensive testing and user feedback, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing proxy attendance and improving administrative efficiency.

These contributions advance the application of biometric technologies in attendance management and provide a practical solution tailored to the needs of educational institutions.
