4.8 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) models the data entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them within the Fingerprint-Based Attendance and Management System. It provides a visual representation of the database structure, facilitating understanding of data organization and constraints.

Key entities include Users, Attendance Records, Sessions, Reports, and Roles. The ERD defines primary keys, foreign keys, and cardinality, ensuring data integrity and supporting efficient database design.
