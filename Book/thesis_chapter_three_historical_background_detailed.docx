3.2 Historical Background

Attendance management has traditionally been a manual process involving paper registers and physical sign-in sheets. This method, while simple, has been prone to errors, manipulation, and inefficiencies. Over time, organizations sought to automate attendance tracking to improve accuracy and reduce administrative burdens.

The introduction of electronic attendance systems marked a significant advancement. Early systems utilized technologies such as punch cards and magnetic stripe cards, which automated data collection but still required physical tokens. These systems improved record-keeping but were vulnerable to proxy attendance and loss of cards.

With the advent of RFID and barcode technologies, attendance systems became more sophisticated, allowing contactless and faster data capture. However, these methods still faced challenges related to security and user authentication.

Biometric technologies, particularly fingerprint recognition, emerged as a reliable solution to these challenges. By leveraging unique physiological traits, biometric attendance systems offer enhanced security, reduce fraudulent practices, and streamline the attendance process.

This historical progression underscores the need for modern, biometric-based attendance systems that address the limitations of previous methods while leveraging current technological capabilities.
