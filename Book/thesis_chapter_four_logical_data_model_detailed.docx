4.9 Logical Data Model

The Logical Data Model defines the structure of data elements and their relationships without considering physical implementation details. It provides a blueprint for database design, focusing on entities, attributes, and normalization.

4.9.1 Data Dictionary (DD)

The Data Dictionary describes each data element, including its name, type, size, and description. It serves as a reference for developers and database administrators to ensure consistent data usage.

4.9.2 Physical Data Model

The Physical Data Model translates the logical design into a physical structure optimized for the chosen database system. It includes table definitions, indexes, constraints, and storage considerations to support efficient data access and integrity.
